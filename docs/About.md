**Backstory**
This was my first web app. The place I was working at asked me to create a system to automate contract employees leave requests instead of using email. Later, they requested that I implement a leave balance tracking feature to replace the Excel sheets they had been using.

The requirements were:

- Each employee has an account.
- Three approval stages: first by the department officer, then by administrative coordination, and finally by HR.
- Email notifications for leave requests and approvals.
- Leave balances with an end date.

 After all that work, the project was abandoned before it went into production.

[[Leave Management System]]
I restarted the project and cleaned up the codebase. This is a development version, running on a dev server and database. It's about 90% ready but still needs testing and configuration before it's fully prepared for production.
